# <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario
Utilizing the 2017 Zillow data set, I set out to build a model that would predict the values of single family homes, examining the correlation between the data points and our target variable (home_value). I will identify critical features that can be used in a regression model to predict home value.

### Goal:
The goal for this project is to create a model that will accurately predict a home's value determined by the county's Appraisal District. To do so, I will have to identify which of the various features are drivers to this end, and implement them into a machine learning regression model. 

### Initial Hypotheses:

>$Hypothesis_{1}$
>
> There is a relationship between square footage and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{2}$
>
> There is a correlation between number of bathrooms and bedrooms and home value.

### Project Planning Initial Thoughts:
- My initial thoughts were that there would be a direct relationship to the total square footage of the property and its appraised value.
- Additionally, I believe there to be a correlation, not just to the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, but also to a ratio of square footage per number of rooms
- To explore this I created a new feature:
    - `sqft_room_ratio`: 'sqft' / ('bedrooms' + 'bathrooms')

## Exploration Takeaways
After removing home_value outliers, especially those homes with more than 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, over a value of $1,500,000, and with a square footage of more than 15,000 sqft. The majority of homes are in the bottom 20% of the overall square footage and bottom 45% of home_value. 

Mean home value = $380,196
Mean square footage = 1774

A more robust combination of cleaned and wrangeled data/features worked best with the regression models.

In Summary:
Following the evaluation of the different models using my selected features, I found that the best performing model was the Polynomial Regressor with degrees = 2
It performs best when above the median home value.

Mean home value = $380,196
Mean square footage = 1774
Mean Bedrooms = 3
Mean Bathrooms = 2
